Dr. Quanlong Guan is currently a Full Professor at Jinan University. He visited Sencun Zhuâ€™s group at The Pennsylvania State University in 2012. His research interest includes robust machine learning, Data Security, semi-supervised learning, recommendation systems and multimodal learning. He has published over 50 papers at leading conferences and journals such as AAAI, ICCV, CIKM, RESS, PR etc. He has 1 highly cited papers in [Google Scholar metrics](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=v4JiSqsAAAAJ&citation_for_view=v4JiSqsAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC). He serves as PC members for top conferences like AAAI, NeurIPS, IJCAI, WSDM etc. He lead several high-value projects, such as multimodal learning, recommendation systems, and Data security. 

**Research interest:** Machine learning, multimodal learning,  semi-supervised learning, recommendation systems, and related applications such as activity recognition, smart education and computer vision. These days, I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models (LLMs) [evaluation](https://llm-eval.github.io/) and [robustness enhancement](https://llm-enhance.github.io/). See this [page](https://chanllon.github.io/research/) for more details. *Interested in [internship](https://www.scholat.com/vpost.html?pid=217741) or [collaboration](https://www.scholat.com/vpost.html?pid=217010)? Contact me.*

**Announcement:** I'm experimenting a new form of research collaboration. You can click [here]() gql@jnu.edu.cn if you are interested!
