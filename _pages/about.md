I'm currently a researcher at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](http://www.msra.cn/). Before joining MSRA, I obtained my Ph.D. from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in June, 2019. My doctoral thesis was awarded the excellent Ph.D. thesis of Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2018/04--2018/08, I was a visitor of Prof. [Qiang Yang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~qyang/)'s group at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My work on transfer learning has won the best paper awards in ICCSE 2018 and FTL-IJCAI 2019. In 2021, I published the textbook [迁移学习导论](http://jd92.wang/tlbook), a hands-on introduction to transfer learning. Never stops looking for highly self-motivated students for internship or collaboration.

Research interest: transfer learning, meta-learning, out-of-distribution generalization, semi-supervised learning, and related applications.
